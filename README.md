### Hi there,  

Working in software development since 2017, I have contributed to the development of applications using Javascript, NodeJS, PHP and frameworks such as AngularJS. I'm currently improving my Java skills, with a focus on the Spring framework. I'm looking for new opportunities as a Java developer.
